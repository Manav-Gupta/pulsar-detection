# Pulsar-detection
This project uses machine learning techniques like LSTM  for the purpose of determining whether a certain star is a pulsar. Pulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable here on Earth. The determination of the type of a star is of great importance since stars have different properties based on their size and emission of waves in different spectrums.
